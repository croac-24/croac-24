- ðŸŒ± Hi, Iâ€™m @Croac-24 (but you can call me Ava)
- I am a student researching wifi (broadband) Access and Affordability in Memphis, Tennesee. 
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have very little regulation. 
- Studies have shown that ISPs disproportionately under-serve people racialized as black and brown and low-income residents.
- Currently, I'm collecting data on public utilities (MLGW), wifi, and transportation
- If you are interested in the topic, have data that would be useful, or know anyone who is researching this, please contact me here:

- Any information or ideas are welcome!
